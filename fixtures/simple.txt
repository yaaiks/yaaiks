SaaS companies doing "AI as a service" have a big wall in front of them called "60%+ of the TAM can't upload their data to random-ass cloud providers much less one run by a guy recently fired by his own board of directors", and for big chunks of finance (SOX, PCI, bunch of stuff), medical (HIPAA, others), defense (clearance, others), insurance, you get the idea: on-premise is the play for "AI stuff".

SaaS enterprises offering "AI as a service" face a significant barrier known as the fact that over 60% of their Total Addressable Market (TAM) are unable or unwilling to entrust their data to just any cloud provider, let alone one managed by an individual recently ousted by their own board of directors. Particularly in sectors like finance (SOX, PCI, among others), healthcare (HIPAA, and more), defense (clearance requirements, and others), as well as insurance, the prevailing trend leans towards on-premise solutions for AI-related services.

"SaaS AI models face significant challenges in regulated industries like finance, healthcare, defense, and insurance due to strict data privacy and security regulations (e.g., SOX, HIPAA, PCI). On-premises deployment may be a more viable option for these sectors due to greater control over data location and compliance."

"Data privacy regulations in industries like finance, healthcare, and defense limit cloud-based AI adoption. On-premises deployments offer potential solutions for compliance and control."

"Strict data governance in regulated industries necessitates careful consideration of AI deployment options. On-premises solutions allow for greater control over data location and compliance, appealing to these sectors."

"On-premises deployments provide unique advantages for AI implementation in highly regulated industries, offering enhanced data privacy, security, and compliance within strict frameworks like SOX, HIPAA, and PCI."

"Leadership changes within cloud providers can influence decision-making in regulated industries where trust and stability are paramount. On-premises AI solutions offer an alternative for organizations prioritizing data control and compliance within specific regulatory environments."
